# fhir-graphql-wrapper
This repository is under construction. 

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a REST application programming interface (API)-focused standard used to represent and exchange health information. FHIR is designed to enable health data, including clinical and administrative data to be exchanged quickly and efficiently. 

With this work, I am trying develop a GraphQL wrapper on the top of FHIR REST service. GraphQL resolves under-fetching & over-fetching inherent in REST architecture. Among many other benefits, following are three prominent ones offered by this solution:

1. Precise data fetching & reduced complexity.
2. Improved developer experience with type safety & predictable data.
3. Smoother API evolution & streamlined maintenance.
